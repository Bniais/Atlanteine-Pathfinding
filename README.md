Commands :

  In-game :

      Space : Scan and find path (first scan gets the game size)

      Alt : Scan the wrong tiles and find path(they are surrounded by a red square)
      
      Echap : Forget the savec game size (if you moved your game window, press it and next scan will get new game dimension)
      
  Editing :
  
      Mouse wheel : Change the tile your mouse is aiming at depending on its content (in the order at bottom)
  
      1-7 : Change the tile your mouse is aiming at (in the order at bottom)

      R : Reset the grid

      Tab _ Find a path





The best path is drawn in bold line. If another shorter path using box exists, it is drawn in thin opposite color line.

Tips :

      At new level, press space when pumpkin starts to fall then spam alt (especially to find where are the tp and to erase the ghosts). 
      
      In some cases, a box can not be found resulting in a lack of found path. Try to rescan with space or try to do the level by your own.
      
      When pumpkin spawn is at extreme bottom right, the time indicator will make the pumpkin not detected. Move it then rescan with space.
      
      At levels 20+, using box path can be really useful when lot of ghosts are in the main path.
      
      Don't use the scans for easy level, it'll just make you lose time and points.
      
      Editing grid during game is generally not worth it.
